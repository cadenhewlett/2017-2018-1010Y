/*  comment dictionary:
 *  1. before a comment have a double space
 *  2. if something is unknown or needs to be expanded on put it in (BRACKETS) to be fixed later
 *  3. to talk about something a function does in a small profile define it in [SQUARE BRACKETS]
 *  4. if a comment ends with a "-" that means it very closely trails into the description of the next code or it simply means "(onwards)" for numbers  ...not always needed
 *  5. notes in comments have a double space then "..." at the start
 *  6. important information is like a note but uses "!!!" at the start and back
 *
 *  organization dictionary:
 *  1. old comments have capital letters, new notes do not  ...fix old comments
 *  2-. (WIP)
